# Code Structure and Layout

This project is a basic Phaser 3 game with the following structure:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the Phaser library and the game's entry point (`src/main.js`).
- `phaser.js`: The Phaser 3 library file.
- `project.config`: Configuration file (content unknown).
- `thumbnail.png`: Project thumbnail image.
- `assets/`: Directory containing game assets.
    - `assets/phaser.png`: Phaser logo image.
    - `assets/space.png`: Background image.
    - `assets/spaceship.png`: Spaceship spritesheet.
- `src/`: Directory containing the game's source code.
    - `src/main.js`: The main game configuration file. It initializes the Phaser game instance and defines the initial scene (`Start`).
    - `src/scenes/`: Directory containing game scenes.
        - `src/scenes/Start.js`: Defines the `Start` scene. This scene loads assets, creates and animates game objects (background, logo, spaceship), and updates the background's scroll position.

The game currently consists of a single scene (`Start`) that displays a background, a logo with a tween animation, and an animated spaceship. There are no explicit game mechanics or automated loops implemented in the current code.
